Live on: https://githubcards-fafdb.web.app/

I made the app live on: https://githubcards-fafdb.web.app/ (Hoisted using firebase).

To Run the app on your local, Follow Steps:

1. **Download** the code
2. run **npm install** to ibstall all the dependecies like firebase, material UI, react libraries etc.
3. run **cd githubcards**
4. run **npm start**

The app is made using React Js. It's completely Responsive. 

1. An Input of github login and Add button to add user cards
2. Delete button on every card for deletion
3. A dropdrop which Sort the users according to the selection, i.e. Name, Location, Followers
4. Clicking on card redirects user to user's public github profile page
5. On Hover over card a tooltip is shown for Bio. (On responsive long press on card to see Bio Tooltip)
6. Toast messages are shown when a user is added/ deleted Or when there exists no user for given name github username/login.
7. Used Cloud Firestore Database for storing fetched data.
8. Used Material UI for Icons
